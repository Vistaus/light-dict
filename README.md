# Light Dict
Lightweight selection-popup extension of gnome shell with icon bar and tooltips-style panel, especially optimized for Dictionary.

## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:tuberry/light-dict.git
cp -r ./light-dict/light-dict@tuberry.github.io ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
```

## Usage

The inspiration comes from two lovely extensions, [SSS](https://github.com/CanisLupus/swift-selection-search) and [youdaodict](https://github.com/HalfdogStudio/youdaodict), in Firefox and I always desire to use them out of browser.

*NOTE* This extension comes with absolutely no warranty and is published under GPLv3.0, also it doesn't offer any icons or dictionary resources though it's named Light Dict. If you have any questions about the usage, feel free to open an issue for discussion.
